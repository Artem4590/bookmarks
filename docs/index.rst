Welcome to the docs for the Nextcloud Bookmarks API!
====================================================

The Nextcloud Bookmarks app provides you with a web interface for collecting and organizing bookmarks to the sites on the web that are precious to you. You can browse and filter your bookmarks via tags and folders and by using the built-in search feature. Furthermore, in order to access your bookmarks anywhere, it also allows you to synchronize third-party clients via a built-in REST API.

These docs describe how to use this API.
